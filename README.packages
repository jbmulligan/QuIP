*************************************** UBUNTU ****************************************

On a fresh ubuntu docker container, install:

git, tcsh, vim, bison, apt-file, texinfo, texlive

To build quip install:

libmotif-dev
libjpeg-dev
libtiff-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libgcrypt20-dev
portaudio19-dev
libgsl-dev

*************************************** CENTOS ****************************************

For building:

texinfo


Here is a list of packages (names for yum,
different for apt-get) that need to
be installed to access all the functions of QuIP:

libpng-devel
libtiff-devel
libX11-devel
#lib-alsa-devel
portaudio-devel	# or portaudio2???
libtermcap-devel
openmotif-devel
#ffmpeg-devel	# this has a different name now???
freeglut-devel
texinfo-tex
libdc1394-devel
gsl-devel
ncurses-devel
opencv-devel
matio-devel
curl-devel		(was libcurl-devel ???)
libgcrypt-devel

Notes:

ffmpeg does not seem to be available for CentOS 6, perhaps need additional repos?

opencv causes a dependency on libdc1394, which gets linked even when not included in the load command???
The solution (from stackOverflow) was the following command:
% sudo ln /dev/null /dev/raw1394

*************************************** MAC OSX ****************************************

NEW:  use homebrew...

packages:

libjpeg
libpng
libtiff
libgcrypt
gsl
portaudio
curl
mactex (--cask)
texinfo
ffmpeg
openmotif
libmatio
ncurses


OLD:  used fink

##########################
For Mac OSX, we are using fink...  the packages have slightly different names.

To install fink itself, we have to install Java JDK, Xcode, command line tools...

Then for a unix build we have to install a few more tools:

autoconf2.6
automake1.15
libtool2

After we can configure and build, we have to start installing more packages
with fink:

libgpg-error
libgcrypt

openmotif4

libmatio2 (or libmatio)
libjpeg9
libtiff5
opencv3.2-dev
portaudio2
libavcodec57-3.0-dev
gsl
