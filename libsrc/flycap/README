Video recording has been unreliable!?

The two disk recorder threads do not always seem to get processor time...
One disk keeps up, while the other falls behind...

This would normally be addressed by increasing the number of buffers, but
(with the help of Brian Cha at PGR support) it has been determined that the
USBFS limit of 16MB is limiting the number of buffers that can be allocated
for  the USB3 Flea3.

This command should fix things on the fly:
% sudo modprobe usbcore usbfs_memory_mb=1000
But usbcore does not seem to be a module???
I changed the setting to 200MB in /etc/default/grub, and then ran sudo update-grub,
and rebooted...

New users on the system don't see cameras in flycap!?
What needs to be done???

On the ubuntu container, these commands needed to be issued to see the cameras:

sudo chgrp flirimaging /dev/bus/usb/010
sudo chgrp flirimaging /dev/bus/usb/010/*
sudo chgrp video /dev/fw?
sudo chmod 660 /dev/fw?
