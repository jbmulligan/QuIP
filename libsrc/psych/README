	this is a general package for running experiments

	OLD:  this was a library that we linked with, providing our
	own c-callable routines for stimulus delivery and parameter
	modification.
	The responsibilities of the caller of exprmnt() :

		define the following global fuction ptrs:
		int (*stim_func)(), (*modrt)();
		initrt points to a routine which is called before each run

	stimrt pts to a routine called with two integer args: class, val
	modrt pts to a routine to modify stimulus parameters

	NEW:  everything should be script-based.  Instead of providing a
	c-callable stimulus routine, for each condition we provide a macro
	to be called.
