In CentOS 6, all of our cards seem to be supported, but the test
script is now working...  we used to test with xawtv - or bttv - or something?

--------------------------------------------------------------

This code was developed to run the LMLBT44 (bttv driver), and
was subsequently used without modification for the Sensoray 811
(saa7134 driver).  The 7134 driver module is not supplied by
default with CentOS 5.6, and has to be built.  This has to done
each time there is a kernel update!?  Although, perhaps for minor
kernel updates, we can simply copy the module to the new location???

Instructions for building module:

see CentOS wiki...
